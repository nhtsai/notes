# Software Design
Software design patterns are general, reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems within a given context in software design.

## Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming

### Abstraction Principle
* Expressing an intent or idea without association to any particular instance.

### Encapsulation Principle
* Hiding data implementations by restricting access to public methods.
* Encapsulate code you expect or suspect might change in the future.

### Polymorphism Principle
* Expressing many forms of one object
* Static Polymorphism (method overloading)
* Dynamic Polymorphism (method overriding)

### Inheritance Principle
* Expressing "is-a" or "has-a" relationships between two objects


## SOLID

### Single-Responsibility Principle

### Open-Closed Principle

### Liskov Substitution Principle

### Interface Segregation Principle

### Dependency Inversion Principle


## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
* "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
* Generalized form of the abstraction principle.

### Creator

### Indirection

### Information Expert

### Low Coupling

### High Cohesion

### Polymorphism

### Protected Variations

### Pure Fabrication
