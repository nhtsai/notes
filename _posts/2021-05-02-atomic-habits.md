# Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

* Small improvements aren't notable or noticeable but are far more meaningful in the long run.
    * A *1% improvement everyday* results in $$1.01^{365} = 37.78$$ change.
    * A *1% decline everyday* results in $$0.99^{365} = 0.03$$ change.

* "Habits are the compound interest of self improvement". The value of consistent, small changes are only apparent after years. 
* Likewise, bad habits can accumulate in many missteps which compound to toxic results.
* "Success is the product of daily habits -- not once-in-a-lifetime transformations."
* Focus on the trajectory of habits. 
    * Outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits, built up from many small behavioral changes.
* Time magnifies the margin between success and failure, in which effects are multiplied after a while.

<br />

| Positive Compounds | Negative Compounds |
| -- | -- |
| **Productivity**: Doing extra work builds up. | **Stress**: Little stresses compound into serious health issues. |
| **Knowledge**: Lifelong learning is transformative. | **Negative Thoughts**: Bad thoughts can skew your interpretation of life. |
| **Relationships**: Small interactions can build a network of strong connections. | **Outrage**: Small aggravations build up to mass outrage. |


* "Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions."
* Habits seem to make no difference until a critical threshold is crossed. This **Valley of Disappointment** is why many people give up on new habits.
* Compounding is not a linear improvement; the most powerful outcomes are delayed, think exponentially.
* Habits need to persist long enough to break through the **Plateau of Latent Potential** in order to make meaningful difference.
* "Change can take years -- before it happens all at once".
* **Systems** are about the process that lead to **goals**, or the results you want to achieve.
    * "Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress."
    * "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

<br />

| Problems with Goals |
| ------------------- |
| **Winners and losers have the same goals**: The difference in outcomes is due to systems of continuous improvements. |
| **Achieving a goal is only a momentary change**: Systems tackle the underlying issues rather than temporarily achieving satisfactory results. |
| **Goals restrict happiness**: You put off happiness until goals are met, rather than falling in love with the process. |
| **Goals are at-odds with long-term progress**: Commitment to the process continuous improvement determines progress. |


* An **atomic habit** is a little habit that is part of a larger system, building up to remarkable achievements through compound growth.


# Chapter 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity

* Changing habits is challenging.
* "We try to change the wrong thing."
    * You should focus on building **identity-based habits** (3 -> 2 -> 1), rather than **outcome-based habits** (1 -> 2 -> 3).

<br />

|| Layers of Behavioral Change ||
| ------ | ----------- | ------ |
| **1. Outcomes** | changing your results, setting goals | *what you get* |
| **2. Process** | changing your habits and systems  | *what you do* |
| **3. Identity** | changing your beliefs, assumptions, and biases | *what you believe* |

* "Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last".
    * You need to change the underlying beliefs that led to past behavior in order to change existing habits.
    * You should change identities to more easily align with new behaviors and habits.
* However, you should not be so attached to any specific identity as to prevent further behavioral improvements.
    * "Progress requires unlearning."
* Repeated behaviors contribute more evidence supporting a gradual belief in a new identity and self-image.

<br />

| Process of Changing your Identity |
| :--- |
| 1. Decide the type of person you want to be. What kind of qualities do they have? |
| 2. Prove it to yourself with small wins. |


* Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits, working in a **feedback loop**.
    * You should let *values*, *principles*, and *identity* drive this loop, rather than results.
* Building habits is fundamentally about **becoming someone**, changing your beliefs about yourself.


# Chapter 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

* Edward Thorndike's studies on cat behavior shows that behaviors that result in favorable outcomes are more repeated than behaviors that result in unfavorable outcomes.
* A **habit** is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
    * Useful actions are reinforced into habits through a "try, fail, learn, try differently" feedback loop.
* Brain activity decreases as it learns the cues that predict success, applying automatic solutions when the conditions are right.
    * The conscious mind can only pay attention to one problem at a time.
    * "Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks."
    * Habits free your mind to focus on new challenges, allowing you to solve problems with as minimal energy and effort as possible.

| : The Four Stages of Habit : ||
| :------- | ------- |
| **1. Cue (Problem Phase)**      | Triggers brain to initiate a behavior, predicts a reward. |
| **2. Craving (Problem Phase)**  | Motivational force or desire to act, linked to a desired change of internal state. |
| **3. Response (Solution Phase)** | The habit (thought or action) you perform, depends on level of motivation and ability. |
| **4. Reward (Solution Phase)**   | The end goal of every habit, *satisfies* cravings and *teaches* which actions are worth remembering. |


* If behavior is insufficient at any of the four stages, the habit will not be formed.
* **Habit Loop** is a neurological feedback loop that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits.
    * "The **cue** *triggers* a **craving**, which *motivates* a **response**, which *provides* a **reward**, which *satisfies* the **craving**, and, ultimately, becomes *associated* with a **cue**."
    * The **problem phase** (**cue** and **craving**) indicates when something needs to change.
    * The **solution phase** (**response** and **reward**) indicates when you take action and achieve the desired change.

* The **Four Laws of Behavior Change** is a simple set of rules used to design good habits and eliminate bad ones.

<br />

| Creating a Good Habit |
| --- |
| **1st Law (Cue)**: Make it obvious. |
| **2nd Law (Craving)**: Make it attractive. |
| **3rd Law (Response)**: Make it easy. |
| **4th Law (Reward)**: Make it satisfying. |


| Breaking a Bad Habit |
| --- |
| **Inverse 1st Law (Cue)**: Make it invisible. |
| **Inverse 2nd Law (Craving)**: Make it unattractive. |
| **Inverse 3rd Law (Response)**: Make it difficult. |
| **Inverse 4th Law (Reward)**: Make it unsatisfying. |
