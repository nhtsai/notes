# Atomic Habits

## Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

* Small improvements aren't notable or noticeable but are far more meaningful in the long run.

    $$\text{1% improvement everyday} = 1.01^{365} = 37.78$$

    $$\text{1% decline everyday} = 0.99^{365} = 0.03$$

* "Habits are the compound interest of self improvement". The value of consistent, small changes are only apparent after years. Likewise, bad habits can accumulate in many missteps which compound to toxic results.
* "Success is the product of daily habits -- not once-in-a-lifetime transformations."
* Focus on the trajectory of habits. 
    * Outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits, built up from many small behavioral changes.
* Time magnifies the margin between success and failure, in which effects are multiplied after a while.


| Positive Compounds | Negative Compounds |
| -- | -- |
| **Productivity**: Doing extra work builds up. | **Stress**: Little stresses compound into serious health issues. |
| **Knowledge**: Lifelong learning is transformative. | **Negative Thoughts**: Bad thoughts can skew your interpretation of life. |
| **Relationships**: Small interactions can build a network of strong connections. | **Outrage**: Small aggravations build up to mass outrage. |


* "Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions."
* Habits seem to make no difference until a critical threshold is crossed. This **Valley of Disappointment** is why many people give up on new habits.
* Compounding is not a linear improvement; the most powerful outcomes are delayed, think exponentially.
* Habits need to persist long enough to break through the **Plateau of Latent Potential** in order to make meaningful difference.
* "Change can take years -- before it happens all at once".
* **Systems** are about the process that lead to **goals**, or the results you want to achieve.
    * "Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress."
    * "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."


| Problems with Goals |
| ------------------- |
| **Winners and losers have the same goals**: The difference in outcomes is due to systems of continuous improvements. |
| **Achieving a goal is only a momentary change**: Systems tackle the underlying issues rather than temporarily achieving satisfactory results. |
| **Goals restrict happiness**: We put off happiness until goals are met, rather than falling in love with the process. |
| **Goals are at-odds with long-term progress**: Commitment to the process continuous improvement determines progress. |

* An **atomic habit** is a little habit that is part of a larger system, building up to remarkable achievements through compound growth.
