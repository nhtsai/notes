# Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

* Small improvements aren't notable or noticeable but are far more meaningful in the long run.
    * A *1% improvement everyday* results in $$1.01^{365} = 37.78$$ change.
    * A *1% decline everyday* results in $$0.99^{365} = 0.03$$ change.

* "Habits are the compound interest of self improvement". The value of consistent, small changes are only apparent after years. 
    * Likewise, bad habits can accumulate in many missteps which compound to toxic results.
    * "Success is the product of daily habits -- not once-in-a-lifetime transformations."
* Focus on the trajectory of habits. 
    * Outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits, built up from many small behavioral changes.
* Time magnifies the margin between success and failure, in which effects are multiplied after a while.

<br />

| Positive Compounds | Negative Compounds |
| -- | -- |
| **Productivity**: Doing extra work builds up. | **Stress**: Little stresses compound into serious health issues. |
| **Knowledge**: Lifelong learning is transformative. | **Negative Thoughts**: Bad thoughts can skew your interpretation of life. |
| **Relationships**: Small interactions can build a network of strong connections. | **Outrage**: Small aggravations build up to mass outrage. |


* "Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions."
* Habits seem to make no difference until a critical threshold is crossed. This **Valley of Disappointment** is why many people give up on new habits.
    * Compounding is not a linear improvement; the most powerful outcomes are delayed, think exponentially.
* Habits need to persist long enough to break through the **Plateau of Latent Potential** in order to make meaningful difference.
    * "Change can take years -- before it happens all at once".
* **Systems** are about the process that lead to **goals**, the results you want to achieve.
    * "Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress."
    * "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

<br />

| Problems with Goals |
| ------------------- |
| **Winners and losers have the same goals**: The difference in outcomes is due to systems of continuous improvements. |
| **Achieving a goal is only a momentary change**: Systems tackle the underlying issues rather than temporarily achieving satisfactory results. |
| **Goals restrict happiness**: You put off happiness until goals are met, rather than falling in love with the process. |
| **Goals are at-odds with long-term progress**: Commitment to the process continuous improvement determines progress. |


* An **atomic habit** is a little habit that is part of a larger system, building up to remarkable achievements through compound growth.


# Chapter 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity

* Changing habits is challenging because you "try to change the wrong thing."
    * You should focus on building **identity-based habits** (3 -> 2 -> 1), rather than **outcome-based habits** (1 -> 2 -> 3).

<br />

|| Layers of Behavioral Change ||
| ------ | ----------- | ------ |
| **1. Outcomes** | changing your results, setting goals | *what you get* |
| **2. Process** | changing your habits and systems  | *what you do* |
| **3. Identity** | changing your beliefs, assumptions, and biases | *what you believe* |

* "Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last".
    * You need to change the underlying beliefs that led to past behavior in order to change existing habits.
    * You should change identities to more easily align with new behaviors and habits.
* However, you should not be so attached to any specific identity as to prevent further behavioral improvements.
    * "Progress requires unlearning."
* Repeated behaviors contribute more evidence supporting a gradual belief in a new identity and self-image.

<br />

| Process of Changing your Identity |
| :--- |
| 1. Decide the type of person you want to be. What kind of qualities do they have? |
| 2. Prove it to yourself with small wins. |


* Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits, working in a **feedback loop**.
    * You should let *values*, *principles*, and *identity* drive this loop, rather than results.
* Building habits is fundamentally about **becoming someone**, changing your beliefs about yourself.


# Chapter 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

* Edward Thorndike's studies on cat behavior shows that behaviors that result in favorable outcomes are more repeated than behaviors that result in unfavorable outcomes.
* A **habit** is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
    * Useful actions are reinforced into habits through a "try, fail, learn, try differently" feedback loop.
* Brain activity decreases as it learns the cues that predict success, applying automatic solutions when the conditions are right.
    * The conscious mind can only pay attention to one problem at a time.
    * "Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks."
    * Habits free your mind to focus on new challenges, allowing you to solve problems with as minimal energy and effort as possible.

|| The Stages of Habit |
| :------- | :------- |
| **1. Cue (Problem Phase)**      | Triggers brain to initiate a behavior, predicts a reward. |
| **2. Craving (Problem Phase)**  | Motivational force or desire to act, linked to a desired change of internal state. |
| **3. Response (Solution Phase)** | The habit (thought or action) you perform, depends on level of motivation and ability. |
| **4. Reward (Solution Phase)**   | The end goal of every habit, *satisfies* cravings and *teaches* which actions are worth remembering. |


* If behavior is insufficient at any of the four stages, the habit will not be formed.
* **Habit Loop** is a neurological feedback loop that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits.
    * "The **cue** *triggers* a **craving**, which *motivates* a **response**, which *provides* a **reward**, which *satisfies* the **craving**, and, ultimately, becomes *associated* with a **cue**."
    * The **problem phase** (**cue** and **craving**) indicates when something needs to change.
    * The **solution phase** (**response** and **reward**) indicates when you take action and achieve the desired change.

* The **Four Laws of Behavior Change** is a simple set of rules used to design good habits and eliminate bad ones.

<br />

| Creating a Good Habit | Breaking a Bad Habit |
| --- | --- |
| **1st Law (Cue)**: Make it obvious. | **Inverse 1st Law (Cue)**: Make it invisible. |
| **2nd Law (Craving)**: Make it attractive. | **Inverse 2nd Law (Craving)**: Make it unattractive. |
| **3rd Law (Response)**: Make it easy. | **Inverse 3rd Law (Response)**: Make it difficult. |
| **4th Law (Reward)**: Make it satisfying. | **Inverse 4th Law (Reward)**: Make it unsatisfying. |


# Chapter 4: The Man Who Didn't Look Right

* The brain is continuously analyzing information and your surroundings, picking up on important cues to predict certain outcomes subconciously.
* You don't need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin.
    * Habits are formed under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind.
* Habits are hard to change because they are so mindless and automatic.
* **Pointing-and-Calling** is the safety system of pointing and calling things out loud in order to reduce mistakes by 85%. It is effective because it raises a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.
* The **Habits Scorecard** is a similar exercise to maintain awareness of your habits and routines.
    * For each action in a list of daily habits, you write a "+", "-", or "=" if it's a good, bad, or neutral habit, respectively.
    * The rating is depending on your situation and your goals. "Good" refers to habits that have net positive outcomes and reinforce your desired identity.
* The goal is to observe your thoughts and actions without any judgements to notice any nonconscious habits.
    * Then you can point it out and say out loud the action and its outcome.
* Behavior change starts with awareness, recognition of habits, and acknoledgement of the cues that trigger them


# Chapter 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit

* An **implementation intention** is a plan made beforehand about when and where to act, detailing how you *intend* to *implement* a habit.
    * Implementation intentions leverage both time and location cues, in the form: "When situation `X` arises, I will perform response `Y`."
* People who make a *specific plan* for *when* and *where* they will perform a new habit are *more likely to follow through*.
    * A lack of clarity, not motivation, is what prevents people from making improvements because it's not always obvious when and where to take action.
    * Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you avoid any distractions or obstacles.

<br />

| Implementation Intention | I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sleeping** | I will sleep for 7 hours at 12AM in my bed. |
| **Studying** | I will study math for 30 minutes at 6PM in my bedroom. |
| **Exercise** | I will exercise for 1 hour at 5PM in my local gym. |
| **Relationship** | I will talk to someone I know for 1 hour at 3PM in my living room. |


* The **Diderot Effect** states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.
    * Many human behaviors follow this principle, deciding on what to do next based on what you have just done; each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.
* **Habit Stacking** is a special implementation intention that pairs a new habit with a current habit, rather than a particular time and location.

<br />

| Habit Stacking | After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]. |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sleeping** | After I brush my teeth, I will go to sleep for 7 hours. |
| **Studying** | After I eat breakfast, I will study for 2 hours. |
| **Exercise** | After I finish my work, I will exercise for 1 hour. |
| **Relationship** | After I eat dinner, I will text a friend or family member to catch up. |


* Habit Stacking allows you to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together, creating a natural momentum of behaviors.
    * Example Morning Routine Stack:
        1. After making a cup of coffee, I will meditate for 60 seconds.
        1. After meditating, I will write my day's to-do list.
        1. After writing my to-do list, I will immediately begin my first task.
    * Example Evening Routine Stack:
        1. After finishing my dinner, I will clean the dirty dishes.
        1. After cleaning the dishes, I will wipe down the counter.
        1. After wiping down the counter, I will prepare my coffee mug for tomorrow morning.
* Habit Stacking works best when the cue if *highly specific* and *immediately actionable*.
    * It's important to select the right cue to kick things off. It should have the same frequency as your desired habit.
    * You can create a list of your daily habits and a list of daily occurrences to formulate the best layering of your daily habit stack.
* The **1st Law of Behavior Change** is *make it obvious*.
    * **Implementation Intentions** and **Habit Stacking** help create obvious cues for you habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action.


## Chapter 6: Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

* Anne Thorndike's studies on environmental design shows that your habits change depending on your environment and the cues in front of you.
    * "Every habit is context dependent."
* Kurt Lewin's equation $$B=f(P,E)$$ describes how *Behavior* is a function of the *Person* in their *Environment*.
* Hawkins Stern's **Suggestion Impulse Buying** describes how customers occasionally buy products due to *presentation* over *desire*.
* Vision is the most important sensory ability, so small changes in **contexts**, or visual surroundings, can greatly impact your actions.
* Obvious visual cues can trigger behaviors more often and better form habits.
    * Creating multiple cues can increase the odds of triggering a behavior.
    * **Environment design** is altering living and work spaces to increase exposure of positive cues and decrease exposure to negative cues.
* Over time, habits will become associated with the entire **context** surrounding the behavior, and the **context** becomes the cue.
* Habits can be easier to change or form in a *new environment*, rather than building habits in the face of competing cues and old contexts.
    * Create separate spaces (rooms or activity zones) for different activities. "One space, one use."
* Habits easily form in stable, predictable environments where everything has a place and a purpose.


## Chapter 7: The Secret to Self-Control

* The **Vietnam War Studies** showed that soldiers addicted to heroin got rid of their addiction overnight after returning to an environment devoid of the cues triggering heroin abuse.
    * This finding challenged the conventional association of unhealthy behavior as a moral weakness or lack of discipline.
* You don't need tremendous willpower and self-control if you don't spend lots of time resisting temptations.
    * Creating a more disciplined environment is important.
    * Habits encoded in the brain can arise again once the internalized cues are present.
* To eliminate a bad habit, exposure to its cues need to be reduced.
* Self-control is a short-term strategy that fails often when willpower is needed to resist temptations in a negative environment.
