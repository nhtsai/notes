## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
* lightweight data representation used to send data between computers
* Commonly used for APIS and configs
* Lightweight and Easy to Read/Write
* Integrates with Javascript (JSON is a superset of Javascript) and most languages

## JSON Types
* Strings: "Hello World", "I", double quotes only
* Numbers: integers, floating point numbers, scientific notation, 10, 1.5, -30, 1.2e10
* Booleans: true, false
* null: null
* Arrays: [1, 2, 3], ["Hello", "World"], access index using brackets
* Objects: {key: value}, keys must be strings, value can be any JSON type, get values using {}.key, {"Age": 30}
* Cannot use a function, a date, `undefined`

## Syntax
* Derived from JS object notation, but JSON format is text only
* Originally specified by Douglas Crockford
* Usually an array or object as top-level of JSON file

```json
{
    "name": "Nathan",
    "number": 3,
    "isProgrammer": true,
    "hobbies": ["Weight Lifting", "Community Service"],
    "friends": [
        {
            "name": "Matthew",
            "number": 22,
            "isProgrammer": true,
            "hobbies": ["Biking", "Relaxing"],
            "friends": null
        }
    ]
}
```


## JSON vs XML
* Similarities
    * "self-describing", human-readable
    * hierarchical
    * parsed by many programming languages
    * fetched using XMLHttpRequest

* Differences
    * JSON doesn't use closing tags
    * JSON is more succinct
    * JSON is quicker to read and write
    * JSON can use arrays
    * *JSON can be parsed by standard JS function, while XML has to be parsed with XML parser*

* Advantages of JSON
    * Faster and easier than XML
    * Parsed into ready to use JS object using `JSON.parse`

```json
{
    "employees": [
        {
            "firstName": "John",
            "lastName": "Doe"
        },
        {
            "firstName": "Anna",
            "lastName": "Smith"
        },
        {
            "firstName": "Peter",
            "lastName": "Jones"
        }
    ]
}
```

```xml
<employees>
    <employee>
        <firstName>John</firstName>
        <lastName>Doe</lastName>
  </employee>
  <employee>
        <firstName>Anna</firstName>
        <lastName>Smith</lastName>
  </employee>
  <employee>
        <firstName>Peter</firstName>
        <lastName>Jones</lastName>
  </employee>
</employees>
```
